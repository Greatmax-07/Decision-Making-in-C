Assignment 1:  Simulation of Electrical Switch

Q] Design a C program to simulate the operation of an electrical switch, where the program takes input values of
either '0' or '1' representing the switch being off or on, respectively. Using a suitable conditional statement,
the program should interpret the input values and display the corresponding condition as "on" or "off". 
Additionally, the program should handle invalid input values and provide appropriate error messages. 

My ideation for the given question:
I developed a program to validate user password inputs, incorporating decision-making logic. 
The program allows users multiple attempts to enter the correct password and includes an option to exit the application if desired.

Input Validation Assurance:
This code does not only handle invalid integer inputs but also any other kind of invalid inputs.
To achieve this I have used the <string.h> library and its string comparision funtion.
